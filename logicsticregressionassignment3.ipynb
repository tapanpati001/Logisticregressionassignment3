    "In the context of classification models, precision and recall are evaluation metrics that are used to measure the performance of a binary classifier. A binary classifier is a type of classification model that predicts the class label of an instance as either positive or negative.\n",

    "\n",
    "Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)\n",

    "ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) is a graphical plot that shows the performance of a binary classification model at different classification thresholds.
